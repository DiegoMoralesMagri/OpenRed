# O-Red Community Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders, we pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sexual characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community:

* Showing empathy and kindness toward others
* Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and accepting constructive feedback gracefully
* Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not only for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing someone else's private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate the reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when an individual represents the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [community@ored.org](mailto:community@ored.org). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are expected to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
