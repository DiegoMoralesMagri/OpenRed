# openredNetwork

Prototype network for OpenRed nodes.

Goals:
- Define a secure node identity and discovery protocol
- Rapid detection of new nodes
- Robust against simple attacks and tampering

Workflow:
1. Discuss design options
2. Choose a design and write a small contract
3. Build a minimal prototype in Python
4. Test locally (two nodes)
5. Harden and iterate

See `DESIGN.md` for initial design notes.
