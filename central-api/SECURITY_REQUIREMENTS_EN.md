# Security Requirements - OpenRed Central API

## üîí Fundamental Security Principles

### 1. Multi-Level Authentication
- **Asymmetric cryptography**: Each node has a public/private key pair
- **JWT with rotation**: Short access tokens (15min) + refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Cryptographic signature**: All requests signed with node's private key
- **Challenge-Response**: Anti-replay mechanism with temporal nonces

### 2. Granular Authorization
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Defined roles (node, admin, service)
- **API Scopes**: Granular permissions per endpoint
- **Rate limiting per node**: Protection against abuse
- **Optional geofencing**: Region restriction if necessary

### 3. Data Protection
- **Encryption in transit**: Mandatory TLS 1.3
- **Encryption at rest**: Encrypted database (AES-256)
- **Secure hashing**: Argon2id for passwords
- **Log anonymization**: No sensitive data in logs

### 4. Resilience and Monitoring
- **Circuit breaker**: Protection against overloads
- **Health checks**: Real-time monitoring
- **Audit trail**: Complete action traceability
- **Automatic alerting**: Anomaly detection

## üõ°Ô∏è Specific Security Measures

### Node Registration
- Cryptographic validation of public key
- Domain ownership verification
- Strict rate limiting on registration
- Automatic blacklisting of suspicious domains

### Node Discovery
- Result filtering based on permissions
- Anonymization of sensitive metadata
- Secure cache with short TTL
- Protection against enumeration

### Message Routing
- Sender and recipient validation
- End-to-end encryption of metadata
- Message size and frequency limits
- Abuse pattern detection

### Administration
- Mandatory multi-factor authentication
- Privilege separation
- Complete audit of admin actions
- IP/VPN restricted access

## üö® Incident Detection and Response

### Automatic Detection
- Suspicious connection attempts
- Abnormal usage patterns
- Denial of service attacks
- SQL/NoSQL injection attempts

### Automatic Response
- Temporary blocking of suspicious IPs
- Automatic revocation of compromised tokens
- Immediate administrator notification
- Automatic fallback to degraded mode

## üìä Security Metrics

### Security KPIs
- Incident detection time (< 1 minute)
- Incident response time (< 5 minutes)
- False positive rate (< 0.1%)
- Service availability (99.9%)

### Regular Audits
- Quarterly penetration testing
- Monthly security code review
- Weekly dependency updates
- Continuous vulnerability monitoring
